1. Problem Statement and Sub-Problems: 

Problem Statement: Foster a calculation to address the absence of a business opportunity for ranchers.

Sub-Problems:
1. Track down possible purchasers for the ranchers' produce.
2. Decide the ideal pricing methodology for the ranchers' produce.
3. Lay out a reliable transportation system for delivering the produce to the market.

Sub-Solutions:
1. Sub-Solution 1: Track down possible purchasers for the ranchers' produce.
2. Sub-Solution 2: Decide the ideal pricing methodology for the ranchers' produce.
3. Sub-Solution 3: Lay out a reliable transportation system for delivering the produce to the market.

2. Write Necessary Functions.

Sub-Solution 1: Track down possible purchasers for the ranchers' produce.
 Function to find potential purchasers
function find potential purchasers (ranchers produce, potential purchasers):
    if potential purchasers are empty:
        return "No potential purchasers found."
    else:
        purchaser choice = potential Purchasers[0]
        for the purchaser in potential purchasers:
            if the purchaser. location is closer to the rancher's location than the purchaser’s choice. location:
                purchaser choice = purchaser
        if the purchaser’s choice is not null:
            return "The chosen purchaser is: " + purchaser choice. name
        else:
            return "No suitable purchaser found."

Sub-Solution 2: Decide the ideal pricing methodology for the ranchers' produce.
Function to determine ideal pricing methodology
function determine Idea pricing (ranchers produce, market prices):
    if market prices are empty:
        return "No market prices available."
    else:
        ideal price = average(market prices)
        if ranchers’ Produce is in high demand:
            ideal price *= 1.2  # 20% markup
        else if ranchers’ Produce is in low demand:
            ideal price *= 0.8  # 20% discount
        if ideal Price > ranchers Cost Price:
            return "Set the selling price as: " + ideal price
        else:
            return "The selling price should cover at least the cost price."

Sub-Solution 3: Lay out a reliable transportation system for delivering the produce to the market.
Function to determine the chosen transportation method
function determines Chosen Transportation (ranchers produce, transportation Options):
    if transportation Options are empty:
        return "No transportation options available."
    else:
        chosen transportation = transportation Options [0]
        for option in transportation options:
            if option delivery time < chosen Transportation delivery time:
                chosen transportation = option
        if chosen transportation is not null:
            return "The chosen transportation method is: " + chosen transportation. name
        else:
            return "No suitable transportation method found."

3. Defining variables:
- find potential purchasers():
    - ranchers Produce List of produce ready to be sold by the ranchers.
    - purchasers: List of potential purchasers interested in buying the ranchers' produce.

- determine deal Pricing():
    - ranchers produce. List of produce ready to be sold by the ranchers.
    - Market prices: List of current market prices for similar produce.
    - Ideal price: Floating-point number to store the calculated ideal price.
    - ranchers Cost Price: Floating-point number representing the cost price for the ranchers' produce.

- determine Chosen Transportation():
    - ranchers Produce List of produce ready to be transported by the ranchers.
    - Transportation Options: List of available transportation methods.
    - chosen transportation: Object representing the chosen transportation method.
